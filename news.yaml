    `Following the lead of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) <http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/12/the-frbny-dsge-model-meets-julia.html>`__,
    an increasing number of central banks have expressed interest in converting their DSGE modeling implementations to Julia.
    To help meet this demand, QuantEcon ran workshops at the Reserve Bank of Australia and the
    Reserve Bank of New Zealand on the 10th and 13th of March 2017.  They were presented by `John
    Stachurski <http://johnstachurski.net/>`__ (QuantEcon and ANU), `Pablo Winant <http://www.mosphere.fr/>`__ (Bank of England),
    `Erica Moszkowski <https://github.com/emoszkowski>`__ (FRBNY) and `Pearl Li <https://github.com/pearlzli>`__ (FRBNY).
    The workshops introduced central bank employees to the Julia programming language
    and its uses in macroeconomic modeling. Slides from the workshop can be found in the `QuantEcon GitHub repository <https://github.com/QuantEcon/RBA_RBNZ_Workshops>`__.

        A few months ago one of us (the one who's better at fly fishing)
        gave a lecture on macroeconomics and
        computational methods at `JuliaCon <http://juliacon.org/>`__.  The
        video can be found `here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkKBwJkYgVk>`__.
        The talk provides a quick overview of the state of modern macroeconomics.
        It is aimed at a general audience with a background in computation, but
        will likely be of interest to some economists as well.  Discussion centers on
        formation of beliefs and expectations, modeling of markets and
        technologies, and associated computational challenges.

        Along with several collaborators, we have created an organization called
        `QuantEcon <http://quantecon.org/index.html>`__ to coordinate
        developement and documentation of open source software for economists.
        This lecture site now falls under the QuantEcon umbrella, as a
        QuantEcon sponsored project.   QuantEcon has been accepted as a member
        of `NumFOCUS <http://www.numfocus.org/>`__, a nonprofit that supports
        open source scientific software development.  Other members of
        NumFOCUS include `IPython <http://ipython.org/>`__, `Julia

        `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__, `pandas
        <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ and `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`__.
        QuantEcon is run for the benefit of the economics community,
        and contributions of code, documentation, ideas or developer time are
        most welcome.  The `QuantEcon website <http://quantecon.org/index.html>`__ provides

        `North American summer meeting of the Econometric Society
        <http://sites.sas.upenn.edu/nasm-2016/>`__.  The workshop will
        provide a quick start introduction to programming in Python and Julia
        for economists.  The target audience is economists with some
        experience with programming in Matlab, Stata or similar, who are
        curious about Python and Julia, and how they might be useful for
        research in quantitative economics.  The `workshop page

        I've seen the future of central bank forecasting and it's written in
        Julia (to paraphrase Jon Landau).  That's right, with a small amount
        of help from the team at `QuantEcon <http://quantecon.org/>`__, the
        FRBNY has converted its main DSGE model from Matlab to Julia.
        Moreover, the code has been `posted on GitHub
        <https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/DSGE.jl>`__, a public repository hosting
        service.  This means that anyone can fork their code, mess around with
        it and suggest changes, using the full power of the open source
        development ecosystem.  This seems like a big win for transparency and
        open science, while at the same time shifting the FRBNY code base to a
        cutting edge language and delivering significant speed gains.

        building up the code libraries and adding many new applications in all fields
        of economics and econometrics.  It will also fund travel, workshops and

        The past few weeks have been spent reorganizing the code library, combining the
        most useful programs into a package called QuantEcon.  In practice this
        means that you can now ``import quantecon as qe``, in just the same way that
        you ``import numpy as np``.  The package can be found on `pypi
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/quantecon/>`__.  Details and installation
        instructions can be found `here <http://quantecon.org/python_index.html>`__.
